A freelance project done for finding and booking parking spots for specific time period in nearby shopping mall parking areas. The app has two types of user accounts. One is for the clients or car owners who are looking for nearby places to park their car and another one is for the admins who are monitoring the parking requests, realtime occupancy status of each shopping mall's parkings and has the permission to add new parkings to the system. This app can be used for not only shpping mall parkings but for any parking lots which are open for renting. Presently an user can find available parking spaces in a proximity of 4 killometers since the number of parking areas are less but later on this number will brought to 0.5-1 killometer range as the number of parking areas increases. Since this app is still in the beta phase so there are more features left to be added in the upcomming releases.
